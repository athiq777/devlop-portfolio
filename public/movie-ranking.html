<h1> the best movies according to anglina </h1>
<h2> top three movies of all the time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> KGF</h3>
<p>I believe kgf is famous for the reason why John wick is famous.

    Both have a lot of similarities between them.<br />
    
    1.Action focused<br />
    
    2. An antihero for a protagonist.<br />
    
    3. A bit dark and gruesome.<br />
    
    4. One man army theme for protagonists.<br />
    
    5. In both movies in many scenes a third person always makes sure the audience remember how badass john wick and rocky are.<br />
    
    And coming back to your question why kgf is popular because it is technically brilliant
    
    Visuals are beautifully shot, should have edited the movie in a bit slower pace.beautiful color grading for every scene.
    
    Audio- mind blowing background score, individual theme music for each main characters, beautifully written songs opt for each scene.
    
    Apart from Ananth nag and Yash most actors are not so famous.yet they gave strong performances like skilled actors.
    
    Prashanth neel's unique style of storytelling is something new in Kannada industry.
    
    Now you watch the movie and tell me why it shouldn't be popular.

    <h3>VIKRAM</h3>
    <p>Vikram is an Indian actor, producer, playback singer and former dubbing artiste known for his work in Tamil cinema. Besides Tamil, he has also worked in Hindi, Malayalam and Telugu language films.<br /> He has featured in over 55 motion pictures, three television programs, and several music videos and commercials.[1][2]

        An aspiring actor since childhood, Vikram modelled for television commercials and appeared in a short film, hoping to get noticed by casting directors.[2][3] He made his television debut with the Doordarshan series Galatta Kudumbam (1988), following which his first feature film role came with the experimental film En Kadhal Kanmani (1990)[4].</p><p> <br />His early career in Tamil cinema saw consecutive box-office failures, after which he attempted a transition to Telugu and Malayalam cinema.[5] Vikram mostly played the lead roles in Telugu films, many of which were financial failures.[2][6] In Malayalam films, he usually appeared in ensemble films, playing "second fiddle" to established actors like Mammootty and Suresh Gopi, which failed to help his career.[5][7] Meanwhile, the few sporadic appearances he made in Tamil cinema also proved unsuccessful.[4]</p>
    <h3>ANIMAL</h3>
    <P>
What did I like?<br />

Ranbir Kapoor’s acting
The violence, especially the before interval fight scene. Damn, that was lit. Manjot, maza nai aa raha, kulhadi de.
A simple story but an incredible presentation.
The last conversation between father and son, I got a lump in my throat.
The non-linear narration
And of course, no one felt offbeat here, every person in this movie was so perfectly cast.
What I didn’t like?<br />

The menace called Bobby Deol was underutilized. Why, why, why? he was just terrific even with his limited screen time.
Now if you want to read more, let me put some FAQs I found on Twitter and let me address them.

<h4>1. Is the movie Animal misogynistic?</h4>

Yes, it is. On certain occasions, the way a woman is treated on screen fills you with disdain. Anil Kapoor doesn’t let his wife speak too much. Ranbir Kapoor asks a woman to lick his boots, tells his sister she will marry the guy he chooses for her and tells his peers, you need to have a strong hold on marriage.

And then some characters marry thrice, so and so. But then it’s not a movie on saints, there is a reason why the movie is titled, Animal.
